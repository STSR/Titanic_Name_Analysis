# Titanic_Name_Analysis
This is the second assignment for CISC 333. The purpose of this assignment was to further develop my understanding of KNIME and start implementing the course material. The task was to try and determine if a persons title correlated to them surviving the Titanic disaster. You can find the KNIME node structure used and the corresponding report in this repository.
